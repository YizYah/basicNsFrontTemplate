NS Basic Template
-----------------
This is a template intended for usage with the [ns-front CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ns-front). 

To use it:
1. clone to your local
2. clone ns-front

This template allows you to create a full-stack app easily using the [NoStack](www.nostack.net) framework.

On the debit side, it doesn't reuse code very well.  But it leaves styling open to you, and contains about the same custom code regions everywhere.  All of the data type component code is divided into replaceable code, so that you have a lot of flexibility.

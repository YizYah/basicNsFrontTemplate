/*
  This file was generated automatically by nostack 'makecode' for the app '{{appName}}'.
  If you build a new stack from a template, this version will probably need to change.

  For instance, it will update if you run 'makecode' again. Fair warning, that will
  change a lot of your code. If you modify your current stack to add actions, sources,
  or types, it would make sense to add constants here.

  But, you should *not* add permanent, separate configuration material
  or other material that is not directly managed by NoStack,
  because this will will be replaced with every call to 'makecode'.
